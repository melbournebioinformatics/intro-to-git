Notes about this workshop:

- Make sure that Windows users use Git Bash for their commands.
- Use VS Code â€“ it's better than teaching nano. If possible, avoid nano entirely.
- Present graph model of commits early on - can use this repository as example.
    - Use VS Code Git tab for that.
- Windows users can struggle with cloning the R repository because Windows doesn't find the Rscript executable.
- In "`cloning-a-repository.md`", follow steps carefully and in order to avoid problems.
- Practice more switching between branches/commits (`git checkout` command).
