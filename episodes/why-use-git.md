### Why use version control?

Now that we've learned what version control **is**, let's understand why we should use it as researchers.

There are a number of reasons to argue that using version control will make us better researchers. That is because 
version control systems can be used for:

- **Backing up your code**  
The most fundamental idea of version control is that you can use it to safely back up your code. That means not only
having a copy of it, but having a copy of each version as your code evolves throughout time. If you use version control
effectively, it will be very difficult for your code to be permanently lost, deleted or erased.

- **Sharing your code**  
Although Git is already explicitly designed to work in a distributed manner, modern version control platforms
make sharing code with others even easier. If our repository is public, anyone can easily access it, copy, and modify the code as they please.
You can make your GitHub profile a portfolio of your coding and analysis projects, with a user-friendly interface.

**Packaging and distribution**

Platforms such as GitHub provide a number of features that facilitate **packaging** our code. One thing is to have a bunch of scripts in
a repository, but if we want to distribute our code effectively, to make it easier for users to acquire and install our code, we can bundle
it as a **software package** and upload it to platforms such as [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/) (for Python) or [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) (for R).

- **Collaborating**  
Sharing code with others is one thing, but Git also enables researchers to work *together* on the same project. You can review other users' commits,
and selectively apply or reject changes that they propose. This is further enabled by GitHub, which makes it easy to do it through the web interface.
Moreover, you can create organisations to host multiple projects, give collaborators write and admin access to projects, and give access to private repositories.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- Version control is like an unlimited ‘undo’.
- Version control also allows many people to work in parallel.
